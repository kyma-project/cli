Alpha commands are experimental, unreleased features that should only be used by the Kyma team. Use at your own risk.

Usage:
  kyma alpha [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Creates resources on the Kyma cluster.
  deploy      Deploys Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.
  disable     Disables a resource in the Kyma cluster.
  enable      Enables a resource in the Kyma cluster.

Global Flags:
      --ci                  Enables the CI mode to run on CI/CD systems. It avoids any user interaction (such as no dialog prompts) and ensures that logs are formatted properly in log files (such as no spinners for CLI steps).
  -h, --help                Provides command help.
      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file. If undefined, Kyma CLI uses the KUBECONFIG environment variable, or falls back "/$HOME/.kube/config".
      --non-interactive     Enables the non-interactive shell mode (no colorized output, no spinner).
  -v, --verbose             Displays details of actions triggered by the command.

Use "kyma alpha [command] --help" for more information about a command.
