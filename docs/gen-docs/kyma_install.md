## kyma install

Installs Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.

### Synopsis

Use this command to install Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.

### Detailed description

Before you use the command, make sure your setup meets the following prerequisites:

* Kyma is not installed.
* Kubernetes cluster is available with your kubeconfig file already pointing to it.

Here are the installation steps:

The standard installation uses the minimal configuration. The system performs the following steps:
1. Deploys and configures the Kyma Installer. At this point, steps differ depending on the installation type.

    When you install Kyma locally **from release**, the system:
    1. Fetches the latest or specified release along with configuration.
    2. Deploys the Kyma Installer on the cluster.
    3. Applies downloaded or defined configuration.
    4. Applies overrides, if applicable.
    5. Sets the admin password.
    6. Patches the Minikube IP.
	
    When you install Kyma locally **from sources**, the system:
    1. Fetches the configuration yaml files from the local sources.
    2. Builds the Kyma Installer image.
    3. Deploys the Kyma Installer and applies the fetched configuration.
    4. Applies overrides, if applicable.
    5. Sets the admin password.
    6. Patches the Minikube IP.
    
2. Runs Kyma installation until the **installed** status confirms the successful installation. You can override the standard installation settings using the `--override` flag.
