[DEPRECATED] Runs tests on a Kyma cluster.

## Synopsis

[DEPRECATED: The "test run" command works only with Kyma 1.x.x.]

Use this command to run tests on a Kyma cluster.

Remarks: 
If you don't provide any specific test definitions, all available test definitions will be added to the newly created test suite.
To execute all test defintions, run `kyma test run -n example-test`.

```bash
kyma test run <test-definition-1> <test-definition-2> ... <test-definition-N> [flags]
```

## Flags

```bash
      --concurrency int        Number of tests to be executed in parallel. (default 5)
  -c, --count int              Number of times every test should be executed. "count" and "max-retries" flags are mutually exclusive. (default 1)
      --max-retries int        Number of times a given test is retried when it fails. A suite is marked with a "succeeded" status even if some tests failed at first and then finally succeeded. The default value of 0 means that there are no retries of a given test.
  -n, --name string            Name of the new test suite. If you don't specify the value for the "-n" flag, the name of the test suite will be autogenerated.
  -l, --selector stringArray   Selector (label query) to filter the tests for the new test suite.
      --timeout duration       Maximum time during which the test suite is being watched, where "0" means "infinite". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  -w, --watch                  Watches the status of the test suite until the tests finish or the defined "--timeout" occurs.
```

## Flags inherited from parent commands

```bash
      --ci                  Enables the CI mode to run on CI/CD systems. It avoids any user interaction (such as no dialog prompts) and ensures that logs are formatted properly in log files (such as no spinners for CLI steps).
  -h, --help                Provides command help.
      --kubeconfig string   Path to the kubeconfig file. If undefined, Kyma CLI uses the KUBECONFIG environment variable, or falls back "/$HOME/.kube/config".
      --non-interactive     Enables the non-interactive shell mode (no colorized output, no spinner)
  -v, --verbose             Displays details of actions triggered by the command.
```
